It takes the value of zero if a firm does not disclose climate risks to CDP in a year, one if it discloses information on one type of climate risks, two if it discloses information on two types of climate risks, and three if it discloses information on all three types of climate risks. This variable is available for the years 2011 to 2016 as CDP did not include this question in 2010 and changed the question design from 2017 onward such that the responses are not comparable anymore for these years.",
