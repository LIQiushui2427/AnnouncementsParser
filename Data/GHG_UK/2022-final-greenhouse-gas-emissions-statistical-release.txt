2022 UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Final Figures
6 February 2024 National Statistics
Despite rises in some sectors as the UK continued to recover from the coronavirus (COVID-19)
pandemic, 2022 saw a fall in greenhouse gas emissions in the UK, largely due to a reduction in
fuel use to heat buildings. In 2022, net territorial greenhouse gas emissions in the UK were
estimated to be 406.2 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO e), a decrease of 3.5%
2
from the 2021 figure of 421.1 million tonnes, and 9.3% lower when compared to 2019, the
most recent pre-pandemic year. Total greenhouse gas emissions were 50.0% lower than they
were in 1990. Carbon dioxide made up 80% of the 2022 total.
UK territorial greenhouse gas emissions, 1990-2022
• The fall in 2022 is primarily due to a reduction in gas use for heating buildings, as a result of
warmer weather than in 2021. Emissions from the buildings and product uses sector fell
13.3%. Higher energy prices may have also caused people to reduce their energy use.
Falls in emissions from industry and agriculture also contributed to the overall reduction.
• In comparison, emissions from the domestic transport sector rose 1.6%. This follows a
period of reduced domestic travel in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions.
Domestic transport was the largest emitting sector, responsible for 28% of all greenhouse
gas emissions in the UK. Emissions from electricity supply also rose by 0.6%.

This publication provides the latest estimates of 1990-2022 UK territorial greenhouse gas
emissions, meaning emissions occurring within the UK’s borders. Figures for all years since 1990
have been revised since the last publication to incorporate methodological improvements and
new data, so the estimates presented here supersede previous ones. We have also introduced a
new set of sectors to present emissions in this publication, see page 29 for more information.
Greenhouse gas emissions are presented in carbon dioxide equivalent units (CO e) throughout

22022 UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Final Figures
Introduction
This publication provides the latest annual estimates of UK territorial greenhouse gas
emissions from 1990-2022. The geographic coverage of this report is UK only unless stated
otherwise. The figures in this statistical release are used as the basis for reporting against UK
greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and provide information for users on the drivers of
emissions trends since 1990. Emissions are estimated following the guidance set out by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)1, as required for the UK’s submissions to
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) each year.
The estimates present emissions on a “territorial” basis, so include emissions which occur
within the UK’s borders, including offshore areas over which the UK has jurisdiction. They
therefore exclude emissions from UK businesses and residents that occur abroad, including
from international aviation and shipping, and any emissions embedded within the supply chain
of manufactured goods and services imported into the UK (while including emissions that occur
in the UK resulting from exported goods and services).
Two additional approaches to estimating UK emissions are also published and the Office for
National Statistics (ONS) has published an article that compares these different measures of
the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions in more detail. The alternative measures are:
• ONS publishes emissions on a “residence” basis in the UK Environmental Accounts. The
figures represent emissions caused by UK residents and businesses whether in the UK or
abroad but exclude emissions within the UK which can be attributed to overseas residents
and businesses.
• The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) publishes the UK’s carbon
footprint. This estimates emissions on a “consumption” basis, meaning it covers emissions
associated with the consumption of goods and services by households in the UK. It
includes estimates of emissions associated with each stage of the supply chain for those
goods and services, regardless of where they occur, while excluding emissions occurring in
the UK that are associated with the consumption of goods and services by households
outside the UK.
Figure 1 shows how the estimates of UK territorial emissions in this publication compare to the
most recent estimates of UK emissions on a residence and a consumption basis. The
estimates are not directly comparable as there are differences in definitions and methodologies
and both the consumption-based and residence-based estimates do not incorporate the latest
methodology changes made to the territorial estimates. However, this does give a good
indication of the relative sizes and trends in each of these estimates, for example the UK’s
consumption-based emissions are considerably higher than its territorial emissions and
followed a different trend over this period, peaking in 2007 and not falling as far as the
territorial and residence-based estimates have since 1990.

The estimates in this publication are based on the source of the emissions rather than where
the end-user activity occurred, so for example emissions related to electricity generation are
attributed to power stations, where the emissions occur, rather than homes and businesses
where the electricity is used. A breakdown of UK territorial emissions with energy supply
emissions presented on an end-user basis will be published as an annex to this publication on
Thursday 28 March 20242.
These estimates cover seven gases: carbon dioxide (CO ), methane (CH ), nitrous oxide
2 4
(N O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulphur hexafluoride (SF ) and
2 6
nitrogen trifluoride (NF ). The last four gases are collectively referred to as fluorinated gases or
3
F gases. In accordance with international reporting protocols, emissions of each gas are
weighted by its global warming potential (GWP)3, so that total greenhouse gas emissions can
be reported on a consistent basis. The GWP for each gas is defined as its warming influence in
relation to that of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. Emissions are then presented in
carbon dioxide equivalent units (CO e).
2
Carbon dioxide is reported in terms of net emissions, which means total emissions minus total
removals of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by carbon sinks. Carbon sinks are defined by
the UNFCCC as “any process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse gas, an
aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere”.
Note that as part of this release the 1990-2021 emissions figures have been revised since the
previous publication in February 2023, to incorporate methodological improvements and new
data, and the 2022 figures have been revised from the provisional estimates published in
March 2023. Details of these revisions can be found later in this statistical release.

emissions from 1990 to the most recent year which is updated annually and reported to the

UNFCCC. The figures in these statistics are consistent with the UK’s Greenhouse Gas
Inventory for 1990-2022, although the inventory reported to the UNFCCC includes emissions
from the UK’s Crown Dependencies and certain Overseas Territories which are excluded from
these statistics except where specifically stated.
In a change from previous publications, greenhouse gas emissions are allocated into sectors
known as Territorial Emissions Statistics (TES) sectors, which have replaced the National
Communication (NC) sectors used in previous publications. More information about this
change can be found on page 29. The TES sectors are as follows:
Electricity Emissions from power stations for electricity generation, including incinerators
Supply generating energy from waste. Excludes emissions from organisations generating
their own electricity (autogeneration) even when exported to the electricity grid.
These emissions are instead included in the sector in which they occur.
Fuel Supply Emissions from the supply of fuels, e.g. oil, gas and coal. Includes activities such as
extraction, production, venting, flaring, processing (e.g. oil refining) and distribution.
Excludes emissions from coke production which are instead included in the Industry
sector as coke is primarily used in the iron and steel industry.
Domestic Emissions from road vehicles, domestic aviation and shipping (including military),
Transport fishing vessels, and railways. Also includes emissions from transport related mobile
machinery (e.g. at airports and ports) and F-gases from mobile air conditioning and
refrigeration. International aviation and shipping emissions are not included in the
national total, though are reported separately.
Buildings and Emissions from fuel combustion in residential, public, and commercial buildings,
Product Uses largely for heating. Also includes emissions from house and garden mobile
machinery, anaesthetics, F-gases from air conditioning, refrigeration, heat pumps,
aerosols as well as other product uses. Excludes emissions from industrial buildings
which are instead included in the Industry sector.
Industry Emissions from fuel combustion in the manufacturing and construction industries,
industrial processes, and F-gases from industrial refrigeration. Emissions from coke
production are included in this sector as coke is primarily used in the iron and steel
industry. Includes emissions from organisations generating their own electricity and
heat (autogeneration) even when exported to the electricity grid or used in heat
networks.
Agriculture Emissions from agricultural machinery and fuel combustion, livestock (enteric
fermentation and manure management) and agricultural soils (excluding carbon
stock changes which are included in the LULUCF sector).
Waste Emissions from the treatment and disposal of waste, such as landfill, composting,
incineration without energy recovery and wastewater handling. Excludes emissions
from incinerators generating energy from waste as these are reported in the
Electricity Supply sector.
Land Use, Includes emissions and removals of CO from changes in the carbon stock in
2
Land Use forestland, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements and harvested wood
Change and products, and emissions of other greenhouse gases from drainage (excl. croplands
Forestry and intensive grasslands) and rewetting of soils, nitrogen mineralisation associated
(LULUCF) with loss and gain of soil organic matter, and fires. As impacts of carbon stock
changes are included in this sector, CO emissions of biogenic origin (e.g. burning
2
biomass for energy) are excluded from other sectors to avoid double counting.
52022 UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Final Figures
2022 total greenhouse gas emissions
In the data tables accompanying this publication, table 1.1 shows UK greenhouse gas
emissions since 1990 by gas and table 1.7 shows emissions by fuel type.
In 2022, emissions in the UK of the seven greenhouse gases that the UK reports
internationally were estimated to be 406.2 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO e),
2
a decrease of 3.5% compared to the 2021 figure of 421.1 million tonnes. Greenhouse gas
emissions in 2022 are estimated to be 9.3% lower than in 2019, the most recent pre-pandemic
year, and 50.0% lower than they were in 1990.
The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2020
and 2021, and while it is not possible to identify the exact size of this effect, the restrictions in
place led to large falls in emissions from transport and businesses. The last of these
restrictions were lifted in the UK during 2022 and the sources of emissions most affected by
the pandemic saw increases as a result, particularly transport. But 2022 was also a much
warmer year than 2021, by 0.8 degrees Celsius on average across the year. These warmer
temperatures led to a large drop in emissions from the use of fuels and electricity to heat
buildings and are the main factor driving the fall in overall UK emissions. Higher energy prices
may have also been a factor in reducing demand for fuels, particularly towards the end of the
year.
When broken down by gas, UK emissions are dominated by carbon dioxide, which is estimated
to have accounted for about 80% of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK in 2022. Weighted by
global warming potential, methane accounted for about 14% and nitrous oxide for about 4% of
UK emissions in 2022. Fluorinated gases accounted for the remainder, around 2%.
Carbon dioxide has always been the dominant greenhouse gas emitted in the UK. Emissions
of carbon dioxide have reduced by 46.3% (around 279.5 MtCO ) since 1990 to 324.2 MtCO in
2 2
2022, mainly due to decreases in emissions from power stations. Emissions of methane have
seen a larger proportional fall (62.5% since 1990) than those of carbon dioxide and so have
,
emissions of nitrous oxide (58.8% since 1990). Fluorinated gas (F gas) emissions are
estimated to be 48.6% lower now than they were in 1990, with hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
being the dominant F gas throughout this time period.

Source: Table 1.1, Final UK greenhouse gas emissions national statistics 1990-2022 Excel data tables
In 2022, 77.6% of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK came from the use of fossil fuels.
Emissions from fossil fuels decreased by 3.8% compared to 2021; they are down 9.4%
compared to 2019 and 46.2% lower than in 1990. Fossil fuel emissions in 2022 predominantly
came from the use of gaseous fuels and petroleum, which accounted for 40.4% and 33.3% of
all UK emissions respectively. Gaseous fuel use in the UK is dominated by the use of natural
gas for heating buildings and for electricity generation, while most petroleum use is in road
vehicles.
Use of coal accounted for 2.3% of emissions in the UK in 2022. Emissions from the use of coal
have fallen by 95.8% since 1990, at which point they were responsible for 27.2% of UK
emissions as it was the main fuel used for electricity generation at that time.

UK performance against emissions
reduction targets
In the data tables accompanying this publication, tables 2.1 and 2.2 show the UK’s
progress against domestic and international emissions reduction targets respectively.
Domestic Targets
The Climate Change Act 2008
The UK has domestic targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the Climate
Change Act 2008 (CCA)4. The CCA has established a long-term legally binding framework to
reduce UK net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 100% below a 1990/95 baseline by 2050
(i.e. Net Zero). The CCA also introduced carbon budgets. These are legally binding limits on
the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions the UK can emit over five-year periods and are
required to be set 12 years in advance of the start of each period5.
Compliance with carbon budgets is not assessed by directly comparing the budget level
against UK net greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, the budget level is compared to the net UK
carbon account, which can also take account of international emissions trading and is defined
for each period in carbon accounting regulations6. Up until 2020, the net UK carbon account
included adjustments for net trading of emissions allowances from UK operators participating
in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)7. The UK left the EU ETS in 2020, and so
adjustments for trading are not applicable from 2021. Further information on EU ETS
adjustments can be found in Annual Statement of Emissions publications8.
The first carbon budget ran from 2008-12. In 2014, it was confirmed the UK had met the
budget with the net UK carbon account 36.5 MtCO e (1%) below the limit of 3,018 MtCO e9.
2 2
The second carbon budget ran from 2013-17. In 2019, it was confirmed the UK had met the
budget with the net UK carbon account 383.9 MtCO e (14%) below the limit of 2,782
2
MtCO e10.
2
Figure 4 shows that the UK has met the third carbon budget, with the net UK carbon account
391.2 MtCO e (15%) below the limit of 2,544 MtCO e. Further information will be published in
2 2
the UK’s Annual Statement of Emissions for 202211 and Final Statement for the Third Carbon
Budget in March and May 2024 respectively.
Projected performance against current and future carbon budgets can be found in UK energy
and emissions projections12.

International Targets
The Kyoto Protocol
Up until 2020, the UK had emissions reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)13.
First Commitment Period (2008-2012)
Collectively with the EU, Iceland and Norway, the UK committed to reduce total greenhouse
gas emissions by 8% on 1990 levels by 2012. As part of this, the UK committed to reduce its
emissions by 12.5% below 1990 levels over 2008-12.
The UK met its commitment, reducing its emissions by around 23% below 1990 levels over
2008-1214. See table 2.2a from the data tables accompanying this publication for emission
figures and further info on the UK’s achievement of this target.
Second Commitment Period (2013-2020)
Collectively with the EU and Iceland, the UK committed to reduce total greenhouse gas
emissions by 20% below 1990 levels over 2013-20. This target was separated into two parts:

• Emissions in scope of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). Predominantly, power
stations, heavy industry, and domestic aviation. The EU was responsible for this part
and set an annually reducing system wide cap on emissions.
• Emissions outside the scope of the EU ETS. Each country was responsible for their
share of these and given an emission allocation over the period represented by
Assigned Amount Units.
UK target under the EU Effort Sharing Decision
To underpin implementation of the EU’s Kyoto Protocol Second Commitment Period target,
The EU Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) was agreed as part of the EU’s Climate and Energy
package. The EU ESD set out Annual Emission Allocations for each country’s emissions
outside the scope of the EU ETS. The UK's Annual Emissions Allocation over 2013-20
translates to an approximate 16% reduction in emissions from 2005 levels.
In June 2023, the European Commission updated the UK’s performance against ESD for 2020
(so that emissions from Northern Ireland EU ETS installations could be accounted for
correctly), confirming the UK’s emissions outside the scope of the EU ETS were below the
Annual Emission Allocation in 202015. The UK has therefore now met all its annual targets
under the EU ESD for 2013-20. See table 2.2c from the accompanying data tables for
emission figures and further info on the UK’s achievement of this target.
UK target under the Kyoto Protocol Second Commitment Period
As described above, the UK collectively committed to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions
with the EU and Iceland. The UK share of this commitment is represented by Assigned Amount
Units which gives a limit on emissions outside the scope of the EU ETS over the 2013-20
period. The UK complied with the target, by ‘retiring’ units corresponding to UK emissions
outside the scope of the EU ETS over the period. The UK submitted its ‘true-up’ report to the
UNFCCC in September 2023 detailing the ‘retiring’ of these units16. See table 2.2b from the
accompanying data tables for emission figures and further information on the UK’s
achievement of this target.
The Paris Agreement
From 2021, the UK has emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Under the Paris Agreement,
the UK is required to set targets every five years known as Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs)17.
First NDC (2030)
The UK has committed to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% by 2030,
compared to 1990 levels18.

102022 UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Final Figures
Emissions by sector
In the data tables accompanying this publication, table 1.2 shows overall UK greenhouse
gas emissions since 1990 by sector and source, while tables 1.3 to 1.6 show this
breakdown for each individual gas.
The sector breakdowns in this publication and accompanying tables are based on TES sectors
and present emissions by source, where emissions and removals are typically allocated to the
sector in which they are emitted or removed from the atmosphere. E.g. emissions from power
stations are included in the electricity supply sector rather than being recorded against the
sectors where the electricity is used. An alternative breakdown where energy supply19
emissions are presented on an end user basis rather than a by source basis will be published
in an annex to this publication on 28th March 2024, in which emissions related to electricity and
fuel supply, e.g. from power stations and refineries, will be reallocated to other sectors based
on where the energy was used.
In 2022, 28% of net greenhouse gas emissions in the UK were estimated to be from the
domestic transport sector, 20% from buildings and product uses, 14% from industry, 14% from
electricity supply and 12% from agriculture. The other 12% was attributable to the remaining
sectors: fuel supply, waste and the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector.
The LULUCF sector includes both sinks and sources of emissions.
Figure 5: Net territorial UK greenhouse gas emissions by TES sector, 2022 (%)

Note: LULUCF is land use, land use change and forestry.
19 Energy supply emissions consist of those in the electricity supply and fuel supply TES sectors, along with a small number of sources in the
industry sector (in particular from coke production and the autogeneration of electricity).
112022 UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Final Figures
Historically, the electricity supply sector had the highest greenhouse gas emissions, but the
large reductions over the last decade in emissions from power stations mean that since 2014
the domestic transport sector has had the highest emissions.

Note: LULUCF is land use, land use change and forestry.
Domestic transport
The domestic transport sector consists of emissions from road vehicles, domestic aviation and
shipping (including military), fishing vessels, and railways. It does not include emissions from
international aviation or shipping. It is estimated to have been responsible for around 28% of
greenhouse gas emissions in the UK in 2022, almost entirely through carbon dioxide
emissions. The main source of emissions from this sector is the use of petrol and diesel in road
vehicles.
In 2020 transport was significantly impacted by COVID-19, as people were instructed to stay at
home as much as possible. COVID-19 restrictions were eased in 2021 and the last restrictions
removed in 2022, resulting in consecutive years of increasing greenhouse gas emissions from
domestic transport to 113.2 MtCO e in 2022, a 2% rise from 2021 and 12% higher than in
2
2020, although this was still 10% lower than in 2019, the last full year before the pandemic. For
most of the period since 1990 domestic transport was the second most emitting sector;
however, reductions over time in what was the largest sector (electricity supply) mean that
since 2014 domestic transport has been the sector with the highest emissions and remains so
in 2022, despite the lower level of emissions in the last three years.
Before 2020 there had been relatively little overall change in the level of greenhouse gas
emissions from domestic transport over the previous three decades, with emissions only 3%
lower in 2019 than they were in 1990. Between 1990 and 2007 (when emissions peaked) there
was a general increasing trend, with some fluctuations year to year. After this peak, emissions
declined most years apart from a period of increase between 2013 and 2017. The impact of
122022 UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Final Figures
the COVID-19 pandemic means emissions are estimated to have been around 12% lower in
2022 than in 1990.
Road vehicles are the most significant source of emissions in this sector, in particular
passenger cars; and the changes which have been seen over the period were heavily
influenced by this category. Figure 7 shows how the volume of traffic on the roads has
changed over time in Great Britain, which reflects the trend seen for the UK as a whole. Motor
vehicle traffic volumes have generally increased throughout this period, other than a fall seen
between 2007 and 2010 following the recession and a large 21% fall in 2020 as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, since when motor vehicle traffic has largely recovered but was still 4%
lower in 2022 than in 2019.
With lower petrol consumption outweighing an increase in diesel consumption20 and
improvements in fuel efficiency of both petrol and diesel cars, the volume of emissions from
passenger cars has generally decreased since the mid-2000s. Although (pre-pandemic) this
was partially offset by an increase in emissions from light commercial vehicles. Emissions of
carbon dioxide are closely related to the amount of fuel used, whilst nitrous oxide and methane
emissions are influenced more by the vehicle type and age.
Civil aviation emissions fell by more than half in 2020 compared to 2019, the largest
proportional fall of any mode of transport, and in 2022 were still 20% lower than in 2019.
Emissions from waterborne transport were 11% lower in 2022 than in 2019, having remained
at a similar level to where they fell to in 2020, and emissions from railways were 19% lower
than in 2019, having seen a partial recovery in 2021 from their 2020 level but a small fall in
2022.

Electricity supply
The electricity supply sector consists of emissions from the combustion of fuels in electricity
generation from power stations. It is estimated to have been responsible for 14% of UK
greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, with carbon dioxide accounting for almost all emissions for
this sector.
There was a 1% increase in emissions from the electricity supply sector between 2021 and
2022, although this was still 5% lower than in 2019. In 2020 and 2021 there was lower demand
for electricity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in 2022 was driven by an
increase in demand for electricity as COVID-19 restrictions were eased.
Between 1990 and 2022 emissions have reduced by 73%. This decrease has resulted mainly
from changes in the mix of fuels being used for electricity generation, including the growth of
renewables; together with greater efficiency resulting from improvements in technology. The
electricity supply sector historically had the largest emissions of the sectors presented in these
statistics. However, these reductions mean that since 2014 this has no longer been the case
and there are now several sectors with higher emissions (the largest being transport).
Since 1990 there has been a decline in the use of coal at power stations and an increase in the
use of gas, which has a lower carbon content so results in fewer emissions. Coal use in
generation reduced by 97% between 1990 and 2022, and now makes up only 3% of the fuel
used for UK electricity generation compared to 65% in 199021. Electricity supplied was 4%
higher in 2022 than in 1990, having grown to a peak in 2005 and decreased since then22. In
2022 the use of gas for electricity generation increased 1% from 2021 and the use of
renewables and nuclear both by 5%, whereas coal saw a 16% decrease.

Note: Figures 9 and 10 show different fuel groupings as not all fuels produce direct emissions, e.g. nuclear and most renewables. The use
of municipal solid waste is included in the renewables category in figure 9 and the use of petroleum in the ‘other’ category.
Fuel supply
The fuel supply sector consists of emissions that arise during the production and supply of
fuels, for example from the combustion of fuels in oil refineries and at oil and gas platforms, the
flaring and venting of gas from oil and gas facilities, leakages from the gas network and
methane emissions from coal mining. It accounted for 8% of greenhouse gas emissions in the
UK in 2022, 98% of which were from oil and gas supply.
152022 UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Final Figures
Fuel supply emissions fell by 1% between 2021 and 2022, largely due to reductions in
emissions from oil platforms and from flaring at upstream oil facilities, and despite a rise in
emissions from oil refineries. Since 1990 fuel supply emissions have fallen by 60%.
The main factor in the long-term decline in emissions in the fuel supply sector has been related
to coal mining. The production of deep-mined coal in particular has declined steadily over the
period, with the last three large deep mines all closing in 2015. Emissions from coal mining and
handling have fallen from 26.5 MtCO e in 1990 to only 0.6 MtCO e in 2022. Oil and gas supply
2 2
emissions rose to a peak in 1996 at 58.2 MtCO e, since when they have fallen by 48%.

Buildings and product uses
The buildings and product uses sector consists primarily of emissions from fuel combustion in
buildings, largely from the use of natural gas and other fuels for heating and cooking, as well
as emissions that directly arise from the use of products such as refrigeration & air
conditioning, garden machinery, anaesthetics, metered dose inhalers and aerosols. In 2022 it
is estimated to have been responsible for 20% of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK. Of
these emissions, 67% were from fuel combustion in residential buildings, 15% in commercial
buildings, 10% in public sector buildings and 7% were other buildings and product use
emissions.
It should be noted that since these figures are estimates of emissions by source, emissions
related to electricity use in buildings – including electricity use for heating – are attributed to
power stations and are therefore included in the electricity supply sector rather than the
buildings and product uses sector.
There was a 13% decrease in emissions in this sector between 2021 and 2022. The warmer
temperatures in 2022 are likely to be one of the main factors, resulting in less energy being
used to heat buildings, and it may have also been affected by higher energy prices, particularly
towards the end of the year. The average temperature across the year was 0.8 degrees
162022 UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Final Figures
Celsius warmer in 2022 than in 202123. Emissions from this sector are particularly influenced
by external temperatures, with colder temperatures driving higher emissions due to increased
use of heating. Between 1990 and 2022 there has been considerable variation in emissions
from year to year as a result. Further information on the impact of external temperatures on
emissions can be found later in this statistical release.
Since the emissions largely relate to fuel combustion, carbon dioxide is the most prominent
gas in the buildings and product uses sector, accounting for 92% of emissions in 2022.
Fluorinated gases (F gases) made up 6% of emissions. Emissions from F gases increased
significantly in the 1990s and 2000s, mainly due to an increase in emissions from refrigeration
& air-conditioning as HFCs replaced ozone depleting substances which were previously used
as refrigerants. This increasing trend has reversed in recent years following the introduction of
the HFC phase down as part of the EU’s 2014 F-Gas Regulation, and F gas emissions in this
sector have fallen by 44% since their peak in 2012.

1990-2022 (MtCO2e)

Emissions from residential buildings fell by 16% between 2021 and 2022. Changes in
emissions from residential buildings from year to year are heavily influenced by external
temperatures but there has been a reduction in the long term, and they were 30% lower in
2022 than they were in 1990. This is despite the UK population rising over this period24 and a
rise in the number of households in the UK25. This fall is partly related to a large fall in use of
coal and other solid fuels for heating homes, which have a higher carbon content than the
other fuels commonly used.
Between 1990 and 2022 there has been a general downward trend in greenhouse gas
emissions from public sector buildings such as schools, hospitals and offices, which have

fallen by 47% over this period. Emissions from commercial buildings on the other hand have
remained at a similar level and were 6% higher in 2022 than in 1990. But in both cases there
has been a change in the fuel mix, with less use of coal and oil, and more use of natural gas.
Both public sector and commercial buildings saw a 9% fall in greenhouse gas emissions
between 2021 and 2022.
Industry
The industry sector includes emissions from fuel combustion at industrial sites and in industrial
machinery, emissions resulting from industrial processes and emissions of fluorinated gases
from industrial uses such as in refrigeration systems. Between 2021 and 2022 there was a 5%
decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from industry, largely because of a reduction in
emissions from industrial combustion and from iron and steel production. The industry sector is
estimated to have been responsible for 14% of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK in 2022,
with carbon dioxide being the most prominent gas.
In 2022, greenhouse gas emissions from industry were 63% lower than in 1990. Between 1990
and 2022 there was a large reduction in emissions from industrial processes of 84%. There
was also a 53% decrease in emissions from industrial fuel combustion over this period, most of
which came between 2001 and 2009, with a significant drop in 2009 likely driven by economic
factors. There has been a gradual decline in emissions from industry in more recent years.
The fall in industrial process emissions over time was most notably due to a large reduction in
nitrous oxide emissions from adipic acid production and HFC emissions from halocarbon
production between 1998 and 1999 following the fitting of abatement equipment at production
facilities. In 2022, the largest source of industrial process emissions was cement production,
with other processes such as sinter, lime, iron and steel, and ammonia production also
contributing significantly.

182022 UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Final Figures
Agriculture
The agriculture sector consists of emissions from livestock, agricultural soils, stationary
combustion sources and off-road machinery. It is estimated to have been responsible for 12%
of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK in 2022. Emissions of methane (58%) and nitrous
oxide (26%) dominate this sector. The most significant sources are emissions of methane due
to enteric fermentation (digestion processes) from livestock, particularly cattle; and nitrous
oxide emissions related to the use of fertilisers on agricultural soils.
Between 2021 and 2022 there was a 2% fall in emissions from the agriculture sector, largely
due to a reduction in fertiliser use and a decrease in emissions from agricultural machinery.
Between 1990 and 2022, greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture decreased by around
12%. Most of this fall happened during the 2000s, since when emissions have remained at a
similar level. The reduction in emissions was driven by a fall in animal numbers over the
period, together with a decrease in synthetic fertiliser use.

Waste
The waste sector consists of emissions from the treatment and disposal of solid and liquid
waste, including from waste disposed of to landfill sites, composting, waste incineration (except
when energy is recovered), and the treatment of wastewater. It is estimated to have been
responsible for around 5% of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK in 2022, with methane
being by far the most prominent gas (accounting for 90% of emissions). Most of these
emissions are from landfill sites.
Emissions in the waste sector remained at around the same level in 2022 as they were in
2021. Between 1990 and 2022, greenhouse gas emissions from the waste sector decreased
by 74%. This was due to a combination of factors, including improvements in the standards of
192022 UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Final Figures
landfilling, changes to the types of waste going to landfill (such as reducing the amount of
biodegradable waste), and an increase in the amount of landfill gas being used for energy.

Source: Table 1.2, Final UK greenhouse gas emissions national statistics 1990-2022 Excel data tables
Land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF)
The LULUCF sector consists of emissions and removals from forests, cropland, grassland,
peatland, and settlements. This sector includes emission removals, although we estimate the
sector as a whole to be a net source of greenhouse gas emissions in each year from the start
of the data series in 1990. In general, peatland is the largest source of greenhouse gas
emissions, while forestry is the dominant sink. Grassland mineral soils changes are estimated
to be an emissions sink throughout the data series, while cropland mineral soils changes and
settlements are estimated to have been net sources of emissions.
The LULUCF sector is estimated to have had net emissions of 0.8 MtCO e in 2022. This is a
2
slight increase from 0.5 MtCO e in 2021 but down from a total of 10.7 MtCO e in 1990. The
2 2
largest factor in this long-term fall has been a reduction in emissions from peatlands
associated with ongoing management practices such as re-wetting. There has also been a
reduction in net emissions from settlements and cropland mineral soils changes, and an
increase in the net sink from grassland mineral soils changes and forestry.

International comparison
UK territorial greenhouse gas emissions account for around 1% of the global total, based on a
range of estimates produced by the UN, the International Energy Agency, and the World
Resources Institute amongst others. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UK and a number of other countries (known as the Annex I
Parties to the Convention26) report their territorial emissions each year to the UNFCCC, while
other countries report theirs every few years. This allows for comparisons to be made between
different countries’ emission estimates following consistent approaches in line with the
guidance set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)27.
Figure 17 shows the most recent territorial greenhouse gas emissions estimates for the UK
and other members of the G20. This year’s comparison now includes the African Union
following its admission into the G20 as a permanent member in 2023. Emissions estimates are
derived from individual countries’ reports submitted to the UNFCCC, apart from for the African
Union for which there is limited data coverage within the UNFCCC reports for several of its
members. Instead, an aggregate total for the African Union has been compiled using World
Resources Institute emissions estimates28. Figure 18 shows this in terms of annual emissions
per person in the population. To be consistent with other countries the UK emissions shown
are the 2021 estimates submitted to the UNFCCC last year, so do not include the revisions to
the estimates shown elsewhere in this publication. The members of the G20 account for
around 85% of world GDP and about two thirds of the world’s population29.
The year the data relates to for each country is shown in the charts, for Annex I countries this
is 2021. As these are territorial emissions, they only include emissions within a country’s
borders, so do not reflect any emissions resulting from the production of goods imported into a
country or any international travel by its residents. The estimates shown include emissions and
removals from the LULUCF sector. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the resulting
worldwide restrictions have had different impacts on different countries since 2020. In general,
2021 greenhouse gas emissions estimates are still lower than pre-pandemic levels in 2019,
although less so compared to 2020 as many restrictions were eased throughout the year.
Countries’ emissions tend to reflect their size, with the highest emissions coming from the
countries with the largest populations and land areas. China is the country with the highest
greenhouse gas emissions, of around 11,200 MtCO e in 2014 (the latest year of data
2
available), followed by the United States, which had emissions of around 5,600 MtCO e in
2
2021. The African Union had emissions of around 4,400 MtCO e in 2020, whilst the European
2
Union (EU 27) had emissions in 2021 of 3,200 MtCO e.
2
When adjusted for population, Saudi Arabia has the highest emissions of G20 countries with
21 tonnes of CO e per person in 2016, while Australia, Canada, and the United States also
2
each had emissions of over 15 tCO e per person in their latest available data. India has the
2
lowest emissions per person in the G20, at around 2 tCO e per person in its latest data from
2
2016, followed by the African Union with emissions per person at around 3 tCO e in 2020. The

UK had emissions of around 6 tCO e per person in 2021. Higher emission rates can be

International aviation and shipping
In the data tables accompanying this publication, table 5.1 shows greenhouse gas
emissions arising from use of fuels from UK international aviation and shipping bunkers
since 1990.
Emissions from international aviation and shipping can be estimated from refuelling from
bunkers30 at UK airports and ports, whether by UK or non-UK operators. Under the reporting
guidelines agreed by the UNFCCC, these emissions are not included in the UK’s emissions
total that is submitted to the UNFCCC but are reported as ‘memo’ items in national greenhouse
gas inventories. However, it is important to note that whether emissions from refuelling at UK-
based international aviation and shipping can be used as an accurate estimate of UK
international aviation and shipping emissions will depend on what assumptions are being made
about how to allocate international aviation and shipping emissions to different countries.
In line with international reporting requirements, the UK’s 2030 emissions reduction target
under the Paris Agreement (known as the UK’s Nationally Determined Contribution) does not
include emissions from international aviation and shipping. Instead, Parties to the UNFCCC
are required to act to limit or reduce emissions from international services working through the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and International Maritime Organization (IMO),
the international organisations responsible for formulating policies and setting targets for
reducing emissions from international aviation and shipping respectively31,32.
However, in 2021 the UK government set the Sixth Carbon Budget (covering 2033-37) to
include the UK’s share of international aviation and shipping emissions, as recommended by
the Climate Change Committee. This is the first time emissions from international aviation and
shipping will be included in the UK’s domestic carbon budget targets.
In 2022, emissions from international aviation fuel use from UK bunkers were estimated to be
28.5 MtCO e. This was around double the 2021 emissions, when it was 14.0 MtCO e, but still
2 2
22.5% lower than in 2019, when it was 36.7 MtCO e. As a result of COVID-19 pandemic
2
restrictions, 2020 and 2021 saw international aviation emissions fall to their lowest annual
figures since these estimates began. Following these easing, 2022 saw an increase in air
traffic towards pre-pandemic levels. In 2022, the number of international flights landing or
taking off from UK airports was more than double the number in 2021 but remained 21.9%
lower than in 201933. Between 1990 and 2006, emissions more than doubled from 15.5
MtCO e to 35.6 MtCO e. After 2006, emissions dipped slightly, then increased again above the
2 2
2006 peak between 2017 and 2019, before the fall in 2020.
High altitude aviation has a greater greenhouse effect due to the formation of persistent
condensation trails (contrails) over and above that of carbon dioxide emissions from fuel alone,
but this is not reflected in these estimates.
Emissions from UK international shipping bunkers were estimated to be 6.3 MtCO e in 2022,
2
an increase of 1.3% from the 2021 level, but still 14.2% below the 2019 figure. Although not as

pronounced a drop as aviation, these emissions remain at lower levels following the fall in
shipping traffic that occurred following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 1990,
emissions from UK shipping bunkers have fluctuated, as can be seen in the chart below, but in
recent years before the reduction in 2020 had been at around the same level that they were in
1990.

Revisions from provisional estimates of
greenhouse gas emissions
Provisional estimates of 2022 UK greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide emissions were
published in March 2023, based on early estimates of energy consumption for the year.
Differences between the provisional and final estimates arise primarily due to revisions to other
statistics on which these estimates were based, use of actual data to estimate non-CO
2
emissions which are only estimated in a simplistic way in the provisional estimates, and
methodological changes to the way emissions are calculated.
Typically, the provisional estimates provide a better indication of emissions trends than of
absolute emissions, as they do not take account of any methodological improvements that may
be made to the way emissions are calculated and which can lead to revisions to the whole
emissions time series from 1990 onwards. More information on revisions to the time series can
be found in the next section.
It was provisionally estimated that total greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 for the UK would be
417.1 MtCO e, representing a 2.2% decrease on 2021 emissions. The final estimates show
2
that 2022 emissions were 406.2 MtCO e, representing a 3.5% decrease on 2021 emissions.
2
Therefore, the provisional greenhouse gas emissions estimates overestimated total
greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 (by 2.7%) and underestimated the percentage decrease in
emissions from 2021 to 2022 (by 1.3 percentage points). The difference in the total is largely
explained by methodology changes made this year and revisions to the energy data used in
producing the estimates.
The provisional estimates are focused on carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector,
and only provide a simplistic estimate of non-CO gases which assumed that the 2022
2
emissions for non-CO gases changed from the 2021 total in line with the percentage
2
difference between the estimates for 2021 and 2022 of total non-CO emissions in the 2019
2
Energy and Emissions Projections34 published by DESNZ. Focusing on carbon dioxide
emissions, it was provisionally estimated that net UK carbon dioxide emissions in 2022 were
331.5 million tonnes. The final 2022 figure of 324.2 million tonnes indicates that the provisional
estimate overestimated CO emissions by 2.3%. Again, this was largely due to methodology
2
changes in the final estimates and revisions to the energy data used in producing the
estimates.
The provisional estimate for emissions of non-CO gases in 2022 was 85.6 MtCO e and the
2 2
final estimate is 82.0 MtCO e, so these emissions were overestimated by 4.4% in the
2
provisional estimates.

Revisions to the UK’s Greenhouse Gas
Inventory
In the data tables accompanying this publication, table 4.3 shows how our estimates of
greenhouse gas emissions in the UK since 1990 have been revised from year to year.
The UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory (the time series of emissions from 1990 onwards which is
the basis for these statistics), is reviewed every year internally and externally (including a
review by the UNFCCC), and the whole historical data series is revised where necessary to
incorporate methodological improvements, changes to international reporting guidelines or new
data. This takes into account revisions to the datasets which have been used in its compilation,
most notably the UK energy statistics published in the Digest of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES).
The methodological changes to the UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory can also impact future
emissions projections. Full details of the methods used to produce the latest greenhouse gas
emissions estimates will be published in the UK’s National Inventory Document (NID)35.
These changes are applied back through the time series to 1990 to ensure that the trend in
emissions from 1990 to the latest year is based on a consistent method. Therefore, it is not
appropriate to compare the emissions time series from one year with that from another.
However, the latest inventory represents a single consistent data series going back to 1990,
and this therefore allows year-on-year comparisons to be made. Estimates of carbon dioxide
emissions between 1970 and 1989 are also published in these statistics, but these no longer
get updated each year and do not include estimates of some of the emission sources included
in the data from 1990 onwards as earlier data are not available.
This section sets out the main methodology changes made this year and describes changes
we have made to the sectors we group emissions into in the statistics.
35 Under the Paris Agreement countries established an enhanced transparency framework. Starting from 2024, countries will now submit an
annual NID instead of the previously required National Inventory Report (NIR). The latest NID covering 1990-2022 emissions will be submitted
to the UNFCCC later in 2024. To enable the use of new reporting tools, the UNFCCC has moved its usual submission deadline of 15th April to
31st December for 2024. Previous UK NIRs can be found here: https://naei.beis.gov.uk/reports/reports?section_id=3

Replacement of NC sectors with TES sectors
Background
In previous iterations of the UK’s official territorial emissions statistics, greenhouse gas
emissions estimates were categorised into ‘National Communication’ (NC) sectors. However,
feedback has shown that these NC sectors were misaligned with the needs of many users.
To ensure that UK territorial greenhouse gas emissions statistics best meet users’ needs, the
Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ) has changed the way UK emissions
sources are categorised, replacing the NC sectors with new ‘Territorial Emissions Statistics’
(TES) sectors.
User feedback and rationale for replacing the NC sectors
Alongside their role in meeting the UK’s international reporting requirements, territorial
emissions estimates have a variety of other uses. Central government departments, devolved
administrations and local authorities use territorial greenhouse gas emissions estimates to
develop policies to reduce emissions, set targets, and serve a variety of users including
policymakers, academics, companies, and the public.
To ensure that UK territorial greenhouse gas emissions statistics best meet users’ needs,
DENSZ sought feedback from key stakeholders ahead of proposed adjustments to the sector
categorisation of UK emissions sources36. Both internal stakeholder feedback and public
feedback found that the NC sectors were not best suited for users; they misaligned with policy
responsibilities and limited users’ ability to identify key emissions sources such as heating
buildings, producing energy from waste, non-road mobile machinery, and upstream oil and gas
production. It was also found that the coverage of the NC sectors was sometimes
misunderstood, in particular the ‘business’ sector given that many of the emissions in other
sectors were the result of activities of businesses, while some sectors did not include certain
emissions that some users would have expected them to, such as emissions from public
transport not being included in the ‘public’ sector and emissions from industrial combustion not
being in the ‘industrial processes’ sector.
In response to these limitations, internal and external users of these statistics have developed
alternative sector categorisations. For instance, DESNZ and the Devolved Administrations
(DAs) use separate sectors for decarbonisation strategies37, whilst the Climate Change
Committee (CCC) has developed its own sector categorisation for reporting advice to
Parliament38.
Building on this feedback, we have developed the TES sectors to make it easier for users to
understand what the main emissions sources in the UK are and to be better aligned with policy
responsibilities within government. We have also introduced subsectors to provide a slightly
more detailed breakdown within every TES sector, as only some NC sectors had them before,
and made some revisions to the categories presented in the statistics within each sector.

Changes to the sector categorisation of UK emissions sources
Figure 20 illustrates the scale of emissions being reallocated between the NC and TES
sectors. Whilst there have been adjustments to the category names within the agriculture and
LULUCF sectors, the overall emissions estimates for these sectors remains unchanged.

Table 2 provides a more detailed breakdown of how emissions sources from the NC sectors
have been reallocated across the new TES sectors. Like the hierarchical NC sectors, the TES
sectors provide a breakdown of emissions at three levels.

Forestry policy. Key changes include the separation of forestry and peatlands related
(LULUCF) emissions into their own sub-sectors, as well as the creation of new categories
within forestry and peatlands that better describe the emissions and removals.

Methodology and data revisions
Alongside the changes to the sectors used to categorise emissions estimates in our statistics
publications, there have been other methodology and data revisions. Unlike the changes to
sector categorisation that have no impact on overall UK emissions totals, these revisions can
lead to revisions to the historical figures.
The most notable methodological change to the historical series since the 1990-2021
Greenhouse Gas Inventory was published are the changes to burning oil emissions estimates
following the use of more detailed DUKES data. This additional detail has allowed for more
appropriate sectoral allocation of burning oil emissions, leading to increased emissions
estimates from burning oil in the buildings and product uses and agriculture sector and
decreased emissions estimates in the industry sector for all years in the time series from 1998.
Other key methodological changes include a more detailed breakdown of non-road mobile
machinery (NRMM) emissions by machinery type allowing for allocation to more suitable
sectors, as well as changes to the HFC Outlook model that have generally reduced F-gas
emissions estimates across the domestic transport, buildings and product uses, and industry
sectors. Revisions to road transport activity data has also led to changes to emissions sources
estimates within the domestic transport sector across the time series. Details of the changes
made to estimates of 1990 and 2021 emissions are given in Table 3. Revisions to other years
of the time series are generally of a similar scale.

Non-domestic burning oil
The allocation of burning oil to end use sectors has been updated to be more closely aligned to
DUKES allocations. In 2022, this has led to around 4 MtCO e being reallocated from the industry
2
sector to the buildings and product uses, and agriculture sectors. This only applies to post-1998;
older data are based on paper copies of DUKES that were not expanded to include this
resolution.
312022 UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Final Figures
Non-road mobile machinery
Following improvements to the non-road mobile machinery (NRMM) model, NRMM emissions
are now better disaggregated by machinery type. Prior to this change, a large share of NRMM
emissions were reported as ‘industrial off-road machinery’ as there was insufficient data
resolution to report them against more appropriate sectors. Now, NRMM emissions can be
allocated to more appropriate sectors. Emissions from refrigerated transport and seaport
machinery (0.7 MtCO e in 2022) which would have previously been reported in the industry
2
sector can now be reported in the domestic transport sector, consistent with the allocation of
emissions from aircraft support vehicles.
This change has no impact on the overall estimate of UK territorial greenhouse gas emissions.
Instead, improvements to the NRMM model allow for a more appropriate and detailed sector
allocation of NRMM emissions.
HFC-sensitivity
Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions are estimated through bottom-up modelling of all UK
equipment and products that use HFCs. Key sources of HFC emissions include refrigeration,
air-conditioning, and heat pumps (RACHP), insulating foams, technical aerosols, and metered
dose inhalers. To verify the HFC emissions estimates included in the UK greenhouse gas
inventory, DESNZ also funds external HFC emissions modelling carried out by the UK Met
Office and Bristol University. These alternative estimates are derived from atmospheric
measurements of HFC concentrations. Previously, there have been significant discrepancies
between the estimates obtained from the two approaches39.
To support Defra’s work on the upcoming revisions of the Great Britain F-Gas Regulation,
several model parameters were reviewed and updated to address the discrepancies with
external model estimates. Overall, these revisions reduce total HFC emissions estimates
throughout the time series. Key changes include:
• A change in the leakage deterioration factor for most RACHP equipment. This factor is
applied to increase the leakage from RACHP equipment after it reaches two thirds of its
life expectancy. Previously, lack of good data necessitated the use of a conservatively
high factor. There have also been modifications to the in-life leakage and end-of-life
emission assumptions for mobile air-conditioning, as well as retail and industrial
refrigeration.
• Modifications to stock assumptions to reflect the rapid growth expected by DESNZ in
the heat pump market.
Semiconductor F-gas use
The models used to estimate semiconductor F-gas use now use real data from industry.
Previously, estimates of semiconductor F-gas use were based on qualitative data. Overall, the
inclusion of new data from industry has minimal impacts on industry sector emissions
estimates across the series.

Recreational N O use
2
There have been several updates to the assumptions included in the recreational N O use
2
model in response to new research indicating that the previous assumptions used were
inaccurate40. The assumption changes are:
• An increase in the mass of N O in a 10mL cartridge from 1.2g to 7.5g.
2
• An increase in the number of N O canisters consumed per session from 1 to 5.
2
These assumptions are considered more evidence-based than the previous ones and sum to
an increase in N O emissions estimates from recreational use.
2
Industrial liquid biofuels
The 2023 publication of DUKES introduced data on the quantities of liquid biofuels used in
unclassified industries together with autogenerators. These data have been incorporated into
the greenhouse gas inventory to include estimates of emissions from these fuels for the first
time, with appropriate emission factors obtained from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) 2006 Guidelines, Volume 2.
Sustainable aviation fuel
The 2023 publication of DUKES introduced data on the quantities of aviation biofuel use.
These data have been used to produce estimates of emissions from these fuels for the
greenhouse gas inventory for the first time, calculating them using the DUKES activity data and
the IPCC Tier 3 methodology for aviation.
Land use, land use change and forestry changes
There have been several methodological updates to the LULUCF sector. These include:
• Several updates to the carbon accounting models that change the estimates of Forest
Land Carbon Stock Change. Notable changes include revisions to the soil model and
the inclusion of urban trees across the whole time series. There are other minor
changes resulting from the estimation of Northern Ireland wood production in private
woodland for the first time. Combined, these changes to carbon accounting models
have the largest impact to emissions estimates amongst the methodological changes to
the LULUCF sector this year.
• Several updates to peatlands emissions estimates. The inclusion of new peat extraction
volume data for Northern Ireland sums to the largest change to organic soils this year.
Peat map revisions for England and Northern Ireland have also affected estimates of
emissions and removals from the LULUCF sector. For Northern Ireland, revisions have
led to a decrease in organic soil areas of 137 hectares. For England, peat map revisions
have led to the inclusion of 2,674 hectares of rewetted bog. There have also been slight
changes to peatland restoration areas in Scotland, including the addition of restoration
areas for domestic peat extraction. Peat map revisions for have also led to minor
changes in cropland areas and estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from cropland.

• New data for estimating forest, grassland, settlement, and cropland areas in the Isle of
Man. The methodology for calculating these areas in the Isle of Man was updated to use
the Land Cover Map (LCM) 2019 dataset that was commissioned by the Isle of Man
Government in 2021. This has resulted in a larger forest area, a smaller grassland area,
and a smaller settlement area. These changes have all led to lower emissions estimates
in the Isle of Man across the time series in these sub-sectors. In contrast, the new data
set now results in a larger cropland area, and therefore higher emissions for cropland.
The overall effect of these changes is lower emissions estimates for the Isle of Man.
• Minor changes to forest land, grassland, settlement, and cropland area estimates for
Guernsey resulting from consistency updates and error corrections.
• Minor LULUCF changes resulting from updated deforestation data and woodland loss
estimates in England. In Scotland, updates to estimates of rewetting have impacted the
split between forest to wetland and forest to grassland areas from 2000 onwards.

Technical information
Methodology for producing greenhouse gas emissions
estimates
It is impractical to directly measure emissions from every exhaust, chimney, and acre of land in
the UK, so greenhouse gas emission estimates are based on a series of models that estimate
emissions from different sources. The source data and methods used to derive UK greenhouse
gas emission estimates have been developed to be consistent with methods defined within
international guidance41. All countries that report to the UNFCCC are required to use these
estimation methods to ensure that the emissions for each country are complete and
comparable.
The basic equation for estimating most sources of emissions is:
For example, to esti𝐸𝐸m𝐸𝐸a𝐸𝐸te𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 C𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸O𝐸𝐸 𝐹𝐹 e𝐹𝐹m𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹is𝐸𝐸s𝐹𝐹i o×ns𝐴𝐴 𝐹𝐹fr𝐹𝐹o𝐸𝐸𝐴𝐴m𝐸𝐸𝐹𝐹 v𝐴𝐴e 𝐷𝐷h𝐹𝐹ic𝐹𝐹l𝐹𝐹es= th𝐸𝐸e𝐸𝐸 a𝐸𝐸c𝐸𝐸t𝐸𝐸iv𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸it𝐸𝐸y 𝐸𝐸d𝐸𝐸a𝐹𝐹ta𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 m𝐹𝐹i𝐹𝐹g𝐸𝐸ht be the total
2
number of kilometres travelled by that type of vehicle and the emission factor the amount of
CO emitted per kilometre.
2
The emission factor is the emission per unit of activity. Emission factors for energy sources are
either dependent on the fuel characteristics (for emissions of CO ) or how the fuel is burned,
2
for example the size and efficiency of equipment used. For other sources, the emission factor
can be dependent on a range of parameters, such as feed characteristics for livestock or the
chemical reactions taking place for industrial process emissions. Emission factors are typically
derived from measurements on a number of representative sources and the resulting factor
applied to all similar sources in the UK.
The UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory uses the best available data from UK and international
research for each emission source. The approach used is largely defined by the availability of
data and the significance of the emission source in the overall UK inventory: more detailed

362022 UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Final Figures
methods are used for the high-emitting sources, whilst simpler methods can be used for minor
sources, consistent with international guidance.
For some sources, the calculation of emissions is more complicated, and therefore a more
complex model is used to estimate emissions. For example, emissions of methane from waste
disposed to landfills are estimated using a model that reflects the fact that the emissions occur
over a long timeframe from the initial disposal of the waste, and that emissions are affected by
the level of capture and utilisation of the landfill methane produced. The CO emissions and
2
removals from land use, land use change and forestry are also modelled.
Table 6.2 in the data tables accompanying this publication summarises the methods and data
sources used to estimate emissions from each source, and there are factsheets published on
the NAEI website42 that summarise the main data sources and methods used for each sector.
More detailed methodology information for each source can be found in the National Inventory
Report submitted to the UNFCCC each year. The report for the 1990-2022 inventory (which
will be known from this year as the National Inventory Document) will be published later in
2024, so the report for the 1990-2021 inventory43 is the most recently available at the time of
this publication.
DESNZ also runs a programme to monitor atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases,
which is used to verify the emission estimates made in the Greenhouse Gas Inventory44.
Estimating emissions on a temperature adjusted basis
In our provisional 2022 UK greenhouse gas emission statistics45 we published estimates of
temperature adjusted emissions, which give an idea of overall trends in emissions without
fluctuations due to changes in external temperatures. The provisional emissions series is
estimated based on UK provisional energy consumption data published by DESNZ and is not
as accurate as the estimates in this statistical release, which are derived from our annual
Greenhouse Gas Inventory. We can compare the latest provisional unadjusted and
temperature adjusted emissions with the final estimates now available.
On a temperature adjusted basis, net carbon dioxide emissions in 2021 and 2022 were
estimated to be 341.5 Mt and 346.0 Mt respectively. The increase in carbon dioxide emissions
between 2021 and 2022 in the temperature adjusted figures was therefore 4.4 Mt, in contrast
to the 8.1 Mt decrease seen in the provisional non-temperature adjusted figures, as shown in
the table below. This suggests that the underlying change between 2021 and 2022 when
adjusted for temperature would be less than the 3.8% decrease shown and could potentially
have been an increase.

Note: The provisional emissions estimates differ from the emissions estimates shown elsewhere in this publication because they were

Uncertainties
In the data tables accompanying this publication, table 4.1 shows the uncertainty in the
2021 UK greenhouse gas emissions estimates by gas and table 4.2 shows it by sector.
These will be updated to show the equivalent 2022 estimates on 28 March 2024.
Estimates of greenhouse gas emissions have an inherent uncertainty due to uncertainty in the
underlying data used to calculate the emissions, and due to uncertainty in the applicability,
completeness, and application of that data. Uncertainty analysis is conducted by modelling the
uncertainty in the underlying emission factors, activity data and other variables within models,
or in the overall model output. The uncertainties are expressed as a 95% confidence interval.
This means that in the uncertainty model 95% of the simulated values fell between the
intervals shown. They are expressed as a single percentage value, which is calculated as
0.5*R/E where R is the difference between the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles and E is the mean.
The overall uncertainty around total greenhouse gas emissions for 2021 is estimated to be
around 2%, as shown in Figure 21 (which is based on uncertainty analysis of 2021 emissions,
as published in 2023). The geographic coverage of the uncertainty estimates includes the UK,
Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories, but uncertainty estimates for the UK only
would be expected to be very similar. Estimates of 2022 uncertainties will be published on 28
March 2024.
The uncertainty of greenhouse gas emissions estimates varies considerably by sector.
LULUCF emissions estimates are the most uncertain, followed by waste and agriculture.
Among the different greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide estimates have the lowest uncertainty
associated with them while nitrogen trifluoride and perfluorocarbons estimates are the most
uncertain.

Future updates to these statistics
On Thursday 28 March 2024 DESNZ will publish a breakdown of 1990-2021 UK territorial
emissions by end-user sector to supplement the source sector breakdown included in this
publication and estimates of the uncertainty in the 2022 emission estimates.
On Thursday 28 March 2024 DESNZ will also publish provisional estimates of UK greenhouse
gas emissions for 2023. This will coincide with the publication of Energy Trends statistics,
which will include estimates of 2023 UK energy consumption.
On Thursday 27 June 2024 DESNZ will publish estimates of 1990-2022 UK territorial
emissions by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), to supplement the sector breakdown
included in this publication.
On Thursday 27 June 2024 DESNZ will also publish estimates of greenhouse gas emissions
by local authority for 2022.
Final estimates of UK greenhouse gas emissions for 2023 will be published in February 2025.

• This statistical release and the related data tables are the first release of data from the
National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) for 1970-2022, produced for DESNZ and
the Devolved Administrations by Ricardo. Additional results will be released as they
become available. For further information on the UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory, see the
NAEI website.
• The UK’s National Inventory Document (NID) for 1990-2022 will be submitted to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) later in 2024. The report
will contain national territorial greenhouse gas emissions estimates for 1990-2022 and
descriptions of the methods used to produce the estimates. Starting in 2024, the NID
replaces the previously required National Inventory Report (NIR). To enable the use of new
reporting tools, the UNFCCC has moved its usual submission deadline of 15th April to 31st
December for 2024. Previous UK NIRs can be found on the NAEI website.
• The background quality report provides a summary of quality issues relating to statistics on
UK territorial greenhouse gas emissions.
• There are uncertainties associated with all estimates of greenhouse gas emissions.
Although for any given year considerable uncertainties may surround the emissions
estimates for a pollutant, it is important to note that trends over time are likely to be much
more reliable. For more information on these uncertainties see the uncertainties factsheet
on the NAEI website.
• Estimates of territorial greenhouse gas emissions in the four countries of the UK are
published on the NAEI website and for local authority areas on gov.uk. In both cases
estimates of emissions in 2022 will be published in June 2024.
• DESNZ also publishes UK territorial emissions projections based on assumptions of future
emission reduction policies, economic growth, fossil fuel prices, electricity generation costs,
UK population and other key variables.

Revisions policy
The DESNZ statistical revisions policy sets out the revisions policy for these statistics, which
has been developed in accordance with the UK Statistics Authority Code of Practice for
Statistics.
Uses of these statistics
The UK’s territorial greenhouse gas emissions estimates are used by central government
departments, devolved governments and local authorities to understand emissions in the areas
they are responsible for, to develop policies to reduce emissions and to set targets. They are
the basis for the UK’s domestic and international emissions targets and are required to be
reported each year to the UNFCCC.
Outside government the statistics are used by the media and the public to understand the level
of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK and trends over time. They provide detailed emissions
data on gases, sectors and sub-sectors that may of interest to users (particularly academics)
with a focus on a particular area of emissions. The data are also the basis of emission
conversion factors that are used by companies and other organisations to report their
greenhouse gas emissions.
Information about user needs for greenhouse gas emissions statistics is published in our
background quality report.
