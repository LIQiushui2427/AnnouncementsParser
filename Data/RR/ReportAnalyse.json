      "Summary": "Rolls-Royce has scaled back its plans to build two new factories for its small modular reactor (SMR) programme in the UK. Initially, the company proposed building one factory for heavy pressure vessels and another for building reactor modules. Due to delays in the government SMR design competition, the plan for the pressure vessels factory has been scrapped, and Rolls-Royce will now procure these from third-party suppliers. The company continues to move forward with the second factory focused on modular assembly.",
      "Quantitative Data": "Two factories planned: One for heavy pressure vessels, another for reactor modules. Delay in SMR design competition impacting the timeline.",

      "Summary": "Rolls-Royce has entered a £15m agreement with Sheffield University to trial manufacturing techniques for SMRs. This investment aims to produce and test prototypes to develop efficient processes for large-scale production. The project is a significant milestone for the company's SMR technology, aligning with the UK’s goal to expand nuclear capacity. This initiative is seen as a key step towards providing cheaper, modular nuclear power.",
      "Quantitative Data": "£15m deal with Sheffield University. Initial £2.7m investment for three prototype modules by the end of the year. Potential further investment of over £15m for 15 types of modules if initial tests are successful. Each SMR projected to cost £2bn, generating 470 MW of electricity. Comparison: Hinkley Point C forecasted to cost £35bn, delivering 3.3 GW.",
