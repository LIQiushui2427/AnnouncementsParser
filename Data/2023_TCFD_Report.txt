Our clients have their own unique needs in adapting to an economy underpinned by the growing importance of
low-carbon technologies, resilient business models and energy security. As a global financial institution, our bankers
continue to develop the expertise they need to best support our clients through their transitions. Our bankers serve
as the primary point of contact for our clients, and they are being equipped with the knowledge, tools and skills
necessary to help clients identify risks and opportunities associated with the transition to Net Zero; understand their
clients’ unique strategic objectives; and provide innovative and tailored product and service offerings across the
platform for all of their needs.
As these efforts are best communicated through a common, comprehensive framework, we continue to leverage the
TCFD framework to disclose how we manage the climate-related risks and opportunities relevant to our business.
This document builds upon our previous TCFD reports and provides an update on our progress over the last year,
noting areas of future focus as we work to reach our Net Zero goal.

2 “Net Zero” is the point at which human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions going into the atmosphere have been reduced as much as possible and
remaining GHG emissions are balanced by carbon removal out of the atmosphere. Achieving Net Zero by 2050 on a global scale is a fundamental component
of limiting temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Source: nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-clocks-july-2023-as-hottest-month-on-record-ever-

perspectives, experiences and expertise help inform and guide how we deliver long-term, sustainable value for our
shareholders and share success with our communities. Our Board actively oversees the Company’s drive toward
Responsible Growth, a key tenet of which is to grow in a sustainable manner, through comprehensive governance and
risk oversight practices.
The Board and the committees that report to it regularly discuss climate-related topics through various channels.
For example:
• The Board receives periodic presentations from management on the Company’s climate-related activities and
climate-related risk management practices and opportunities.
• The Board’s CGESC, which has specific responsibility for overseeing the Company’s environmental and social
sustainability-related activities and practices, regularly reviews the Company’s climate-related work and policies.
• The Board, in coordination with its Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC), oversees climate risk — a risk that spans
across all key risk types — as set forth in the Company’s Board- and ERC-approved Risk Framework and Risk
Appetite Statement (RAS).5 To this end, the Board and the ERC receive quarterly risk reporting and periodic deep
dives that address and provide updates on key and emerging risks, including climate risk.
• The Board, through its Audit Committee, periodically reviews the Company’s enterprise climate disclosures in
its financial reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Audit Committee also
receives regular updates on global developments in climate-related reporting.
Key topics covered with the Board and/or its committees include our sustainable finance activities, updates on the
execution of our Net Zero goal, our 2030 emissions reduction targets related to our financing activities, climate-
related oversight requirements, regulatory landscape and the continued enhancement and evolution of the climate
risk management efforts.
5 In the Risk Framework and RAS, climate risk is identified as a risk spanning all seven key risk types and the RAS includes a qualitative component outlining how
the Company manages climate risk in a manner consistent with Responsible Growth.
GOVERNANCE TABLE OF CONTENTS | 10Management oversight
Supporting the Board in its oversight of climate-related activities are management-level committees comprised of
senior leaders across every major LOB and control function.6 Among these, the Management Risk Committee (MRC),
co-chaired by our chief executive officer (CEO) and chief risk officer, oversees risks facing the Company, taking
into consideration climate risk, which spans across all key risk types. The MRC reports to the Board’s ERC and is
supported by subcommittees organized by risk type (e.g., credit, market, operational) and LOB, which also review the
implications of climate-related risks.
The Responsible Growth Committee (RGC) is responsible for overseeing the Company’s mandate to grow in a
sustainable manner and works to accelerate our progress on environmental and social initiatives, including climate.
The RGC is co-chaired by our chief administrative officer and our vice chair, who was formerly our chief financial
officer, and currently oversees the Company’s sustainability activities and stewards our work and progress to achieve
our Net Zero goal. Its members are comprised of senior leaders representing each LOB and control function. The RGC
is accountable to the CEO and is supported by the ESG Disclosure Committee, which is responsible for reviewing and
providing oversight of our climate and other sustainability-related public disclosures.
The RGC engages in dialogue and debate on sustainability issues that are significant to our business. It escalates
relevant sustainability matters and related risks to the CGESC and to the MRC, respectively. It is charged with
providing overall leadership for the Company in environmental and social areas, and it monitors our focus on
climate transition and sustainable finance across our LOBs as we work to meet our Net Zero goal. The details on
our approach to Net Zero and the 2030 Financing Activity Targets outlined herein were approved by the RGC and
reviewed by senior management and the Board.
We have established a climate program, which includes various workstreams to help achieve our climate objectives
(Climate Program). The Climate Program Executive Steering Council (Climate SteerCo) coordinates and integrates the
capabilities required to drive the execution of our work in these areas. Additionally, the Climate Risk Council, which
consists of leaders across risk, LOBs and control functions, meets routinely to discuss our approach to managing
climate-related risks in line with our Risk Framework. This council is overseen by the climate and environmental risk
executive, who reports to the corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental risk executive, a member of the
chief risk officer’s leadership team.
In addition, since our last report, we have established the role of corporate sustainability controller to oversee the
controls and governance around our climate reporting.
6 Control functions provide guidance and subject matter expertise on day-to-day activities affecting the Company and include Legal, Global Human Resources
and certain groups within the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer Groups and Global Strategy and Enterprise Platforms.

At Bank of America, we work across the enterprise to actively engage with and bring our full
suite of financial solutions to mobilize and deploy capital for our clients as they transition
Assist toward a low-carbon economy. We are guided by Responsible Growth which positions us to
deliver for our shareholders, clients, teammates and communities.
We recognize that there are challenges with transitioning to a low-carbon economy, but we also think there are
opportunities — for innovation, jobs and growth. Given our global presence and relationships with customers across
industries and in more than 35 countries, combined with the experience of navigating our own climate journey, we
believe we are well positioned to assist our clients and provide them with the advice and financial solutions necessary
for them to achieve their transition goals.
Across our eight LOBs, we focus on helping individuals navigate every stage of their financial lives, working with
companies, small to large, to help drive the world economy forward, and providing insights, ideas and award-winning
research for institutional investors. Many of our original perspectives on the economy, sustainability and global
transformation are publicly available on the Bank of America Institute website. Our goal is to position Bank of America
as the financial partner of choice for clients, whether they are at the beginning of understanding how climate change
could impact them or well on their way to managing the energy transition. All our LOBs partner closely with several
enterprise-wide functional teams including the GSFG, SBSG, GEG, CSR and others to drive progress toward Net Zero,
including identifying opportunities to support our clients in their transition.
In 2021, we set a goal to mobilize and deploy $1.5 trillion of sustainable finance capital by 2030. Aligned with the
17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), $1 trillion is dedicated toward the Environmental
Transition and $500 billion toward Inclusive Social Development. Through this commitment, we advance the

Our position on carbon credits and their role in achieving Net Zero
While we prioritize emission mitigation in our approach to reaching Net Zero, we also recognize the important role that high-integrity carbon credits play in reducing global emissions. Nature- and technology-based carbon removal
measures will be critical in reaching Net Zero, and we believe it is necessary to both reduce emissions in alignment with science and support the development of a robust carbon market with high quality projects.
Supporting the carbon market
We plan to continue to engage with The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market, Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative, Global Carbon Trust, Energy Transition Accelerator and other convening organizations with the
intention of improving the framework and governance of a market for high quality carbon credits.
Developing a high-integrity, liquid and efficient voluntary carbon credit market, in addition to a new compliance carbon credit market under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, will be essential for achieving Net Zero targets. A robust
carbon market is expected to play an increasingly important role in achieving decarbonization at lowest cost in addition to providing resiliency, preserving biodiversity and other co-benefits.
Bank of America structured and executed numerous voluntary carbon credit and compliance transactions in 2022. These include transactions completed with project developers, traders, hedge funds, an engineering and construction firm
and oil refining and distribution companies, transacted on the Verra and ACR registries, as well as California Carbon Allowances, Low-Carbon Fuel Standard, Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and EU allowances.
In 2022, Bank of America made a direct investment in Xpansiv, a leading infrastructure provider helping to build efficient and transparent environmental commodities markets in support of energy transition. Xpansiv provides brokerage,

To reach and maintain carbon neutrality for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 business travel emissions, we reduce our location-based emissions, purchase sustainable aviation fuel, purchase 100% of electricity from renewable sources and
acquire carbon credits to address our residual emissions. More information on our use of carbon credits can be found in our Performance Data Summary.
When selecting carbon credit projects, we focus on those that address multiple UN SDGs. One project that demonstrates this approach is a sustainable infrastructure project that reduces and prevents gas leakages within a gas
distribution network. The project financed the purchase and import of specialized leak detectors and advanced sealant materials to provide long-lasting sealing of identified leaks. Additional benefits of the repairs include reduced risks
of accidents and hazardous pollution from gas leaks, creation of jobs for local residents and reduced emissions from leaked methane. This project aligns to multiple UN SDGs, such as Good Health and Well-Being, Decent Work and
Economic Growth and Climate Action.
Financing activity
To reach our 2030 Financing Activity Targets, we intend to apply client use of carbon removal credits to our 2030 targets as the data is available and as we have established an internal review and due diligence process. These credits
will have to meet specific criteria including certification by a credible body that follows leading guidance in the industry and are used in combination with a science-aligned emission reduction commitment. We recognize this area is
rapidly evolving and will continue to track leading guidance on the application of carbon credits.

Operations
As noted previously, as part of our efforts to achieve and maintain carbon neutrality in our operations, we purchase carbon credits for residual emissions. As we evaluate opportunities to offset our emissions, we prioritize credits that
can benefit communities that are experiencing disproportionate impact during this transition. One example is a reforestation project on land previously under extensive grazing by beef cattle, which has generated jobs that protect native
ecosystems and provides food and financial stability for the community.
Financing activity
Our GCIB and Global Markets teams are incorporating this approach into a range of financing strategies and opportunities, both in the U.S. and around the world. The teams work to mobilize and deploy capital to advance environmental
sustainability and socioeconomic empowerment for underserved populations and in underserved regions. Domestically, this includes our recent Equality Progress Sustainability Bond for $2 billion, designed to help advance racial and
gender equality, economic opportunity and environmental sustainability.
Internationally, we work with the Sustainable Markets Initiative and other forums to partner with governments, regional lenders, development finance institutions and philanthropies to bridge the funding gap and mobilize private capital
toward sustainable development in emerging markets. Our work includes exploring opportunities with development finance institutions and energy developers in Africa, supporting Just Energy Transition Partnerships with both Indonesia
and Vietnam, and previously providing a loan facility to a developer building renewable energy and clean transportation infrastructure projects located in Small Island Developing States in the Caribbean. For additional information on
these and other transactions focused on assisting underserved and disproportionately impacted communities through the transition, please see Assisting our clients.
Philanthropy
We are funding energy efficiency for affordable housing, workforce programs that expand access to clean energy jobs and programs to connect minority contractors with the growing opportunities afforded by greenhouse gas reduction
efforts. We are also investing in work by the National Wildlife Federation to support local communities’ access to federal funding opportunities that will support legacy pollution mitigation and build resilience to extreme weather threats.
A particular focus for us continues to be urban tree planting — a nature-based resilience solution to address impacts of extreme heat and related health issues. Minority and low-income communities have fewer trees in their
neighborhoods, which means those neighborhoods are hotter and more dangerous during extreme heat events. Heat is the number one killer among extreme weather events in the U.S. — more than hurricanes, tornadoes, floods or
wildfires.32 We have partnerships with American Forests and the Arbor Day Foundation, which are both working to address this historic challenge in these communities.
Also related to extreme heat, we have supported work by the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center of the Atlantic Council that details the economic and social consequences of extreme heat, including the
disproportionate impacts on poor or marginalized communities in the U.S. and provides recommendations for cities around the world to enhance climate resilience and reduce heat impacts. The Center’s work aims to increase awareness
of the dangers of extreme heat, for example by advocating to name heatwaves.
Additionally, we are funding work by the Nature Conservancy to develop plans that protect marine ecosystems across the globe while also promoting the economic viability of local economies. We have also worked with Water.org to
expand access to clean and safe water through small loans that are used to create access to clean and safe water and sanitation in homes without those basic necessities. See Appendix 4: Key Partnerships for additional philanthropic
relationships supporting a balanced and just transition, such as the Oxford University Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment.

Our position on nature-related risks and opportunities
Agriculture, forestry and other land use are together the second largest contributor to global GHG emissions
behind the energy sector, primarily due to deforestation and land conversion.33 As forests are depleted, we lose
one of the world’s most vital carbon sinks,34 which accelerates climate change. Furthermore, the world’s oceans
are being devastated by climate change and resource exploitation, which threatens ocean ecosystems’ vital role in
keeping carbon sequestered, creating an unsustainable climate change feedback loop.35
In 2022, Bank of America participated in the United Nations Biodiversity Conference of the Parties (COP) in
Montreal. We support the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework agreed in December 2022 including
Target 15 on corporate reporting aligned with the recommendations of Task Force for Nature-related Financial
Disclosures (TNFD), in which we participate.
We are working to assess the impacts that nature-related risks may have on our business, as well as how our
business activities may be contributing to nature loss. To this end, we are building out capabilities to better
understand concentrations of various environmental risks — including biodiversity loss — across our portfolio’s
industry segments, starting with our global corporate banking portfolio.
At the same time, we see increased opportunities to deploy capital into nature-positive areas aligned with our
commitment to mobilize and deploy $1.5 trillion in sustainable finance by 2030. For example, we are engaging
with clients to arrange financing through thematic and structured bonds that focus on biodiversity and debt-for-
nature provisions. The Company is also leveraging its leadership position with corporate clients in sustainability-
linked balance-sheet financing by looking for opportunities to link our clients’ nature-related targets to different
sustainability-linked financing products. We are engaged in raising capital for companies active in emerging areas
such as the alternative protein and sustainable farming sectors, and we have deployed capital into blended
finance vehicles with a focus on natural capital, such as climate-smart and regenerative agriculture and food
systems transformation in emerging and developing economies. Evidence of our capital contributions include
our investments in the Responsibility Climate Smart Agriculture & Food Systems Fund and the Bamboo Capital
ABC Fund.

Our Commodities business is also active in the voluntary carbon credits market with a focus on nature-based solutions such as carbon soil sequestration, reforestation and afforestation. We are providing our clients with access to high-
integrity carbon credits with an emphasis on removal in line with guidance from market-shaping organizations such as the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market and the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative. When
evaluating carbon credit opportunities used to offset our own residual operational and supply chain emissions, we prioritize credits that also benefit underserved and disproportionately impacted communities. See our approach to
Carbon credits for more information on how we use carbon credits and support the carbon market.
We also participate in coalitions to provide thought leadership and help advocate for nature-positive outcomes. For example, we are a member of the Natural Climate Solutions Investment Accelerator which aims to build the demand-
side for investment in nature-based solutions. We are also on the Steering Committee of the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance which is exploring how to scale investment in areas such as blue carbon36 to deliver both carbon
removal and co-benefits such as restoring ocean ecosystems and improving the resilience of coastal communities. See Appendix 4: Key Partnerships for the Company’s additional nature-related engagements.
We have also dedicated philanthropic resources to support innovative approaches to leveraging sustainable finance to preserve nature. For example, we are funding efforts by The Nature Conservancy and local leaders in Barbados to
build out a marine spatial plan that will protect 30% of the country’s marine areas by 2030. Execution of the plan will then be funded by proceeds from a blue bond that was issued by the Government of Barbados with co-guarantees
provided by InterAmerican Development Bank and The Nature Conservancy. Previously, we supported efforts by The Nature Conservancy to develop an insurance policy for coral reefs that could be damaged during extreme weather
events. Similar policies are now in place in Mexico and in Hawaii, with more jurisdictions looking to employ this strategy. In addition, we have been a long-time supporter of Ocean Conservancy, participating in its Trash Free Seas Alliance
and supporting the International Coastal Clean-up, an annual global effort to remove debris from coastlines, as well as inland waterways, preventing this trash from polluting marine ecosystems.
To provide transparent disclosure of our work to address nature-related risks and opportunities, we may begin to integrate information aligned to the TNFD framework into our existing sustainability reporting. Additionally, one
of Bank of America’s executives is a member of the 40-person TNFD taskforce, whose mission is to develop a risk management and disclosure framework for organizations to report and act on evolving nature-related risks and
opportunities. Furthermore, to encourage consistency across the financial sector’s approach to assessing and disclosing financial institutions’ impacts and dependencies on biodiversity, we are a formal supporter of the Partnership
for Biodiversity Accounting Financials (PBAF).
Our approach to high deforestation-risk activities:
While we work to further refine and develop our approach to managing nature-related risks, we have the following policies in place to manage our exposure to high deforestation-risk activities:
• Forestry: We developed our Forests Practices Policy, including our position on Forest Certification and Paper Procurement Policy, in consultation with our clients who have expertise in the sector and with environmental partners
focused on developing best practices, including forestry certification. Our Forests Practices Policy places additional value on forestry certification by using it as a due diligence tool. The Forests Practices Policy also includes an
explicit prohibition of illegal logging and practices involving uncontrolled fire.
• Palm oil: We require clients whose business is focused on ownership and management of palm oil plantations and operations, including growers and mills, to have their operations certified, or have in place an outlined action plan
and schedule for certification. We use the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification or equivalent certification standards as a minimum requirement for clients and monitor developments relating to the sustainable
sourcing of palm oil.
• UNESCO World Heritage Sites: We respect the designation of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites, including areas of natural or cultural value that are deemed to be of
national or international significance. Bank of America will not knowingly engage in transactions focused on natural resource extraction within UNESCO World Heritage Sites unless there is prior consensus between UNESCO and the
host country’s governmental authorities such that the activities will not adversely affect the natural or cultural value of the site.

enterprise risk management practices to drive Responsible Growth and enhance preparedness for a low-carbon,
climate resilient future. It is expected that the Climate Risk Framework will evolve over time as best practices in
climate risk management continue to mature.
Risk Identification
To be effectively managed, climate risk must be proactively identified and well understood. Risk identification is an
ongoing process that incorporates input from stakeholders across LOBs and CFs with relevant expertise. It is designed
to be forward-looking and capture relevant risk factors to which we are or may be exposed. LOBs and control functions
identify risks that are captured consistently in an enterprise-wide risk inventory and reviewed quarterly.
We have enhanced our risk identification process to incorporate climate-related factors such as physical (acute and
chronic) and transition risk across LOBs and control functions. We are continuing to explore opportunities to expand
risk identification capabilities related to physical and transition risk and the resulting impacts to our businesses and
are expanding the current Risk Identification portal to embed additional climate risk considerations. This includes

consumer preference to utilize green products in certain regions can also impact profitability in high-emitting
industry sectors.
The scenario analysis demonstrated that various sectors of the economy may be impacted in different ways
depending on the nature of the scenario. While specific industries like energy and transportation were significantly
and consistently impacted due to the nature of the sectors, climate-related government policies and regulations
designed to reduce GHG emissions can have a significant impact on all sectors of the economy by affecting the value
of financial assets, the profitability of corporations and the preferences of consumers. It can also prompt a change
in fossil fuel prices relative to renewable energy prices and impact income and creditworthiness of some borrowers.
Consequently, the cost of transition can affect the value of market portfolios of banks and insurance companies. It
can also increase credit risk as the economic impact of transitioning to a lower emissions economy can affect the
debt servicing capacity of counterparties along with other potential impacts.
The speed at which climate risk could impact us whether through government policy change, rapidly evolving
consumer preferences or the markets repricing certain assets varies based on the multiple ways in which the
risks manifest themselves, highlighting the importance of sensitivity analysis. With over $1.2 trillion in committed
commercial credit exposure (as of December 31, 2022) spanning nearly every sector of the global economy, it is
possible that we could experience credit losses or lose market share and/or revenue associated with climate-related
transition risk if our current or future clients do not successfully transition to a lower emissions economy.
However, the transition to a Net Zero economy also presents opportunities for the Company, such as financing
investments in technological developments supporting the transition and working with clients to manage policy risk
and tap into new financing incentives. Some sectors are more directly and immediately impacted by the transition,
but Net Zero has implications across all parts of the economy and will require major investment into decarbonization
solutions over the next 30 years. Introducing a dynamic balance sheet into our scenario analysis allowed us to begin
